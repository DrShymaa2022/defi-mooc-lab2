  Liquidation

did we reach here?

position is liquitable with HF= 993100606912132067

total collateral value= 10630 ETH

The total debt= 8093 ETH

Liquidation Threshold = 7561

LTV=  7082

 a 1 step liquidation run to test the max liquidated collateral & gain in the 1 step case

      

after 2nd liquidation WBTC balance= 941397681

 with address of this= 5689287880 WBTC

position should be not liquitable by now HF= 1013104985547432409

total collateral value in ETH after 2nd lquidation= 9684 ETH

The total debt is 7233 ETH

Liquidation Threshold = 7567

LTV=  7090

  

So we liquidated in both steps; difference in collateral= 946 ETH

From them the debt is reduced by; ie, difference in debt= 860 ETH

The difference between the two, is what we gained as a liquidator before reducing the pool ratio= 86 ETH

amountIn= 893587145258318241406

WBTC balalnce= 272277356
